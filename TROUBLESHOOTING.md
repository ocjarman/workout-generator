# Troubleshooting "Invalid Compact JWS" Error

## Summary

Your Auth0 configuration appears to be set correctly (audience values match), but you're getting an "Invalid Compact JWS" error. This guide will help you debug and fix the issue.

## What Changed

I've added extensive debugging to both client and server to help identify the exact problem:

### Client Side (App.tsx)
- ‚úÖ Added token validation (checks if JWT has 3 parts)
- ‚úÖ Added detailed console logging
- ‚úÖ Added helpful error messages with solutions

### Server Side (index.ts)
- ‚úÖ Added request logging
- ‚úÖ Added token inspection (length, parts count)
- ‚úÖ Added detailed error responses
- ‚úÖ Better error handling with hints

## How to Debug

### Step 1: Clear Auth0 Cache

The most common cause of this error is **stale Auth0 data** in your browser.

1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the **Console** tab
3. Run this command:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear(); sessionStorage.clear(); location.reload();
   ```

### Step 2: Restart Your Servers

```bash
# Stop both servers (Ctrl+C)

# Terminal 1: Start the server
cd server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start the client
cd client
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Login and Check Console Logs

After logging in, check **both** the browser console and the server terminal for detailed logs.

#### What You Should See in Browser Console (Success):

```
üîê Attempting to get access token...
‚úÖ Token retrieved successfully
Token length: 800 (or similar, should be 200+)
Token preview: eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6...
üì° Sending user data to: http://localhost:3000/api/users/me
‚úÖ User synced successfully: {id: 1, email: "user@example.com", ...}
```

#### What You Should See in Server Terminal (Success):

```
üì® Received POST /api/users/me request
Authorization header present: true
Token length: 800
Token preview: eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6...
Token parts: 3 (should be 3 for JWT)
Auth0 ID: auth0|123456789
User email: user@example.com
‚úÖ User synced successfully: 1 user@example.com
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Token has only 1 part (Opaque Token)

**Symptom:**
```
Token parts: 1 (should be 3 for JWT)
```

**Cause:** Auth0 is not issuing JWT tokens because the audience is not being used.

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you've created an **API** in Auth0 Dashboard (not just an Application)
2. Verify `VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE` in `client/.env` matches your Auth0 API identifier
3. Clear browser cache and login again

### Issue 2: "consent_required" error

**Symptom:**
```
‚ùå Error syncing user: {...}
‚ö†Ô∏è User consent required for API access
```

**Solution:**
1. Go to Auth0 Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Applications** ‚Üí **APIs** ‚Üí Your API
3. Go to **Settings** tab
4. Enable **"Allow Skipping User Consent"**
5. Save changes
6. Clear browser cache and login again

### Issue 3: Audience mismatch

**Symptom:**
```
InvalidTokenError: Invalid Compact JWS
```

**Solution:**
Run the test script to verify configuration:
```bash
./test-auth0.sh
```

Make sure the audience values match exactly:
```bash
# Should output the same value
grep VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE client/.env
grep AUTH0_AUDIENCE server/.env
```

### Issue 4: Token is undefined or null

**Symptom:**
```
Token length: undefined
Authorization header present: false
```

**Solution:**
1. Check that your Auth0 Application has the API permissions
2. In Auth0 Dashboard ‚Üí Applications ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí APIs tab
3. Make sure your API is authorized
4. Check the scopes are granted

## Verify Your Auth0 Setup

### Check 1: Auth0 API Exists
1. Go to [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/)
2. Navigate to **Applications** ‚Üí **APIs**
3. You should see your API (e.g., "Workout Generator API")
4. Click on it and note the **Identifier** (this is your audience)

### Check 2: Environment Variables
Run the test script:
```bash
./test-auth0.sh
```

All checks should pass ‚úÖ

### Check 3: Application Settings
1. Go to **Applications** ‚Üí **Applications** ‚Üí Your App
2. Click on **APIs** tab
3. Make sure your API is listed and authorized

## Still Not Working?

If you're still getting the error after following these steps:

1. **Copy all the console logs** from both browser and server
2. **Check the token at jwt.io**: Copy the token from the console and paste it at https://jwt.io/
   - If it says "Invalid Token", that confirms it's not a proper JWT
   - If it decodes successfully, the issue is with the verification

3. **Verify Auth0 Dashboard Settings**:
   - Domain matches: `dev-k72b14bf7lqd4jeh.us.auth0.com`
   - Audience matches: `https://workout-generator-api`
   - API uses RS256 signing algorithm

4. **Try a fresh login**:
   - Logout from your app
   - Clear all browser data (localStorage, sessionStorage, cookies)
   - Close and reopen the browser
   - Login again

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test Auth0 configuration
./test-auth0.sh

# Check environment variables
cat client/.env | grep AUTH0
cat server/.env | grep AUTH0

# Restart servers
pkill -f "node.*server" && pkill -f "vite" && cd server && npm run dev & cd client && npm run dev
```
